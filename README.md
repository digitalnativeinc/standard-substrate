## Pre-requisites

### Supported architectures

| Architecture  | Native | Docker |
| ------------- | ------ | ------ |
| amd64         | 游릭     | 游릭     |
| windows-amd64 | 游댮     | 游댮     |

### Rust

Installation instructions can be found locally [here](./docs/rust-install.md), or by navigating to [Substrate docs](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/).

### Docker

If opting in to use Docker, you will need to install both Docker and Docker Compose - once integrated compose goes to GA separate installation of docker-compose will not be required. Up to date docs can be found here for [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and for [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Using Local Standard Protocol parachain

All commands used are referenced in a [Makefile](./Makefile).

### Initialise Rust

This step is required to work with Substrate.

```bash
make init
```

### Build project without running

```bash
make build
```

### Run project

Will build as well if not done in a previous step.

```bash
make localrun
```

## Using Docker Standard Protocol parachain

Runs docker compose which builds and runs the image.

```bash
make compose-run
```
